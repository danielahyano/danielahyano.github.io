      What if we could make it snow whenever we want? <br>
      Well, we are not quite there, but we can still control the snow falling on the screen with this interactive device:

      <p>
        This device has a blue enclosure, with a joystick and a button, that allows to control the snow fall and also the color of the sky.
        The box was made with a blue cardboard paper and it is connected to the computer through a cable c type wire. Here's what the enclosure
        looks like:

        <br>
        <br>
        To make the box, I used a ruler to divide the cardbox into four pieces (top, bottom, left and ride sides), as well as a small 
        pieces at the end to allow for closing the box.

        <br>
        <br>
        Inside the box, the EPS32 is located, and a breadboard and cable was used to connect the ESP32 to the joystick and the buttons:

        <br>
        <br>
       
        The joystick port SW was connected to the ESP32 port 17, port VRY connected to port 13, and port VRX connected to port 12. 
        Furthermore, the joystick is connected to the ground and the 3V port. The button is connected to port 21 and ground.

      <p>
        This project was part of a collaborative art installation project with all the students of 
        the Barnard College Creative Embedded Systems.
        Each student/artist came up with an individual art piece, such as a poem, phrase, and lyrics, 
        using a small screen as a display. 
        <br>
        <br>   
          The idea for my individual project came from the fact that in the contemporary world, 
          although most people are connected by the internet, people still feel lonely. In an infinite loop, 
          the screen starts by showing the phrase "I am lonely.". Right after, the screen is filled with random messages 
          and notifications -- such as "Sent a cat video". The messages and notifications fill out the screen in an overwhelming way, 
          trying to reproduce how overwhelming this technological world can feel. Moreover, the feeling of being trapped into this 
          routine is transmitted as the screen is trapped in an infinite loop. The art piece fits into the installation as the class 
          combines art and technology, the idea of bringing into art one of the biggest problems that technology brought, especially 
          for our generation.

      <h2>Technical Details</h2>
      <p>
        One problem encountered in the installation was that we initially were going to use LiPo batteries, but I had a problem when I was
        soldering: accidentally created a closed circuit. Therefore, due to safety reasons, we decided to use a DC converter.

        If you want to implement the same code, you can find the source code and a read me with the implementations details in my Github page:
